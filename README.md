# BlackJackV2

This is a revised version of the blackjack game that I originally developed as my final object-oriented programming assignment with another student. The original version was rough, and my lack of experience was evident. In this second attempt, I aimed to create a more maintainable version that is easier to followâ€”with reduced coupling between objects, a clearer separation between the game logic and the GUI, and proper use of design patterns, with MVVM chief among them.
