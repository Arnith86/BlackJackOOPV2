# BlackJackV2

**BlackJackV2** is a fully restructured version of a Blackjack game originally developed as part of a final assignment in object-oriented programming. While the first version showed early efforts, this second iteration is a comprehensive rewrite focused on clean architecture, maintainability, and scalability.

Key improvements in this version include:
- Clear separation of concerns using the **MVVM** pattern.
- Decoupled and testable architecture via **Dependency Injection**.
- Modular design through **interface-driven factories** and **event-based communication**.
- Enhanced gameplay features, such as **multi-player support** and the ability to **split hands**.
- Well-structured and reusable components using **generic abstractions** (`ICard<TImage, TValue>`, `ICardDeck<TImage, TValue>`, etc.).
- Organized folder structure aligned with scalable project practices (e.g., `/Models`, `/Services`, `/Factories`, `/Shared`, `/ViewModels`, `/Views`).

The goal of this project is to serve both as a feature-rich game and a learning base for how to structure large-scale Avalonia UI applications using best practices.
